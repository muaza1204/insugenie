             { id: 1, question: "How often should I check my glucose levels?", answer: "It depends on your treatment plan. Consult your doctor for personalized advice. Typically, it's recommended to check before meals and before bedtime, or as advised by your healthcare provider. More frequent testing may be needed if you use insulin, are pregnant, or are experiencing symptoms of low or high blood sugar." },
             { id: 2, question: "What foods should I avoid?", answer: "Minimize sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates (white bread, pasta, sugary cereals), and processed foods high in unhealthy fats (trans fats, excessive saturated fats). Focus on whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (from avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil)." },
             { id: 3, question: "Can I reverse diabetes?", answer: "Type 2 diabetes can often be managed and sometimes put into remission (often referred to as 'reversal') through significant lifestyle changes like healthy eating, regular physical activity, and achieving a healthy weight. Remission means blood sugar levels are within the non-diabetes range without medication. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition and cannot be reversed." },
             { id: 4, question: "What are the symptoms of high blood sugar?", answer: "Common symptoms include frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), excessive hunger (polyphagia), fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and unexplained weight loss. If you experience these symptoms, check your blood sugar and consult your doctor." },
             { id: 5, question: "How can I prevent diabetes complications?", answer: "Maintaining blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels within target ranges is crucial. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, not smoking, and attending regular medical checkups (including eye exams, foot exams, and kidney function tests) are essential for preventing long-term complications like heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye problems." },
             { id: 6, question: "What is A1C and why is it important?", answer: "A1C (or HbA1c) is a blood test that provides an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It reflects how well your blood sugar has been controlled over time. It's a key indicator for assessing the risk of long-term complications and the effectiveness of your diabetes management plan. Your doctor will set a personal A1C target for you, often below 7% for many adults." },
             { id: 7, question: "How does exercise help with diabetes?", answer: "Physical activity helps lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity (making your body's cells more responsive to insulin). It also helps with weight management, improves cardiovascular health, lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, and reduces stress. Aim for a mix of aerobic exercise and strength training." },
             { id: 8, question: "What should I do if my blood sugar is low?", answer: "If you experience symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia, typically below 70 mg/dL), follow the '15-15 rule': Consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (like glucose tablets, 4 ounces of fruit juice or regular soda, or 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey). Wait 15 minutes and recheck your blood sugar. Repeat if necessary. Once your blood sugar is back in your target range, eat a small snack if your next meal is more than an hour away. Always carry a source of fast-acting sugar." },
             { id: 9, question: "What are common diabetes medications?", answer: "Medications vary depending on the type of diabetes, individual needs, and other health conditions. They can include oral medications (like Metformin, Sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors), injectable non-insulin medications (like GLP-1 receptor agonists), and various types of insulin. Your healthcare provider will determine the most appropriate medication regimen for you." },
             { id: 10, question: "How does stress affect blood sugar?", answer: "Stress can cause your body to release hormones that can increase blood sugar levels. Chronic stress can make diabetes management more challenging. Finding healthy coping mechanisms for stress, such as exercise, mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or seeking support from a mental health professional, is important." },
             { id: 11, question: "Is it safe to drink alcohol with diabetes?", answer: "Alcohol can affect blood sugar levels, potentially causing hypoglycemia hours after consumption, especially if you take insulin or certain oral medications. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation (up to one drink per day for women, up to two for men), with food, and monitor your blood sugar closely. Avoid sugary mixers. Discuss safe alcohol consumption with your doctor." },
             { id: 12, question: "What is diabetic neuropathy?", answer: "Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by high blood sugar over time. It most commonly affects the nerves in the legs and feet (peripheral neuropathy), causing symptoms like pain, tingling, numbness, or loss of sensation. It can also affect nerves controlling internal organs (autonomic neuropathy). Good blood sugar control is the primary way to prevent or slow the progression of neuropathy." },
             { id: 13, question: "How important is foot care for people with diabetes?", answer: "Foot care is critically important. Diabetes can lead to reduced blood flow and nerve damage in the feet, making them vulnerable to injuries, infections, and slow-healing sores (ulcers). These can potentially lead to serious complications, including amputation. Inspect your feet daily, wash them gently, keep them dry, wear well-fitting shoes, and have them checked by a healthcare professional at least annually." },
             { id: 14, question: "What is diabetic retinopathy?", answer: "Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. High blood sugar damages the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated. Regular comprehensive eye exams (at least annually) are essential for early detection and treatment." },
             { id: 15, question: "How does diabetes affect kidney health?", answer: "Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy). High blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, impairing their ability to filter waste from the blood. Good blood sugar and blood pressure control are vital for protecting kidney function. Regular urine tests (for albumin) and blood tests (for creatinine) are used to monitor kidney health." },
